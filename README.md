# Dotfiles

I mostly use this to keep track of and store my own dotfiles, but you are welcome to use them or parts of them as well. Some files might depend on certain scripts in .local/bin/ or externam programs. All files are licensed under the [GNU GPL v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)
